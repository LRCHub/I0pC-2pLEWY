I'm just a bad boy
Long, long ways from home
I'm just a bad boy
Long, long ways from home
But I ain't got nobody
To bury me when I'm gone

Well, I'm the cat that scratches
And I'm like a dog that bites
I'll be your box of matches, baby
When you need a light

I'm just a bad boy
Long, long ways from home
But I ain't got nobody
To bury me when I'm gone

I used to have a little girl
Only sixteen years old
But her mom and dad put me way out
Way out in the cold, yeah

I can't stay here no longer
My luck is running slow
I gotta keep on moving
But I ain't got no place to go

I'm just a bad boy
Long, long ways from home
I'm just a bad boy
Long, long ways from home
I swear I ain't got nobody
Nobody's gonna bury me when I'm gone

But I ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Hey, ooh
